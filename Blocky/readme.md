## NMAP SCAN [intensive scan]

Lets visit the website.
![index.php](https://github.com/jakobgoerke/HTB-Writeups/blob/master/Blocky/images/index.png "index.php")
After doing some basic enumeration (dirbuster, nikto, WPscan), we see that it is a Wordpress Website and a directory called /plugins. We also see that there is /phpmyadmin.

Let's download the BlockyCore.jar and extract it.
We see, theres a blockycore.class, which could get interesting.
And yes, it is indeed interesting. After running **strings** on it, we see something really juicy:

![strings](https://github.com/jakobgoerke/HTB-Writeups/blob/master/Blocky/images/strings.png "strings blockycore.class")
This looks like the credentials for some database login stuff.

We should test if these are the credentials for **phpmyadmin**.
And yes, they are.

Okay. Keep calm and pwn. Let's see what the wpusers database is about.

Who that could be.. Maybe the ssh user?!

After testing the password for SSH: we got in and successfully got the **user.txt**.

But don't stop. Glad i had a checklist for privilege escalation. (https://blog.g0tmi1k.com/2011/08/basic-linux-privilege-escalation/) After checking some stuff, **sudo -l**, we see that i can run every command as notch. So Why don't we just run **sudo -i** to get root?
And yes, we got it.

Boom. got it. Awesome machine, great experience.
